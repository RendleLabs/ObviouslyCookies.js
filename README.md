ObviouslyCookies.js
===================

Stupid EU legal compliance in one (long) line of JavaScript

### TL;DR

The European Union made [a law](http://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/) saying that all web sites that create any kind of cookie must display a message alerting their users to this fact. That basically translates as all web sites. So I made the shortest script I could to satisfy the letter of this law, and this is it. Please feel free to use it as is, or adapt it as you like.
